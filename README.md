Here I am implementing a basic user registration system in an Express.js project with CRUD operations and logging using Winston. Here's a breakdown of how the logging mechanism and CRUD operations would work in your project:

Steps:
1. Setting up Winston Logging:
Create a **logger.js** file in the **util** folder.
Configure Winston to handle different levels of logs such as **error**, **warn**, **info**.
Use log rotation or file output if needed.

2. Using Winston in Controller:
Import the logger in your controller files.
Replace **console.log()** with **logger.error()**, **logger.warn()**, or **logger.info()** based on the log level.

3. Handling Errors:
Create a **logError()** function in your logger file or controller to handle server errors.
Use **logError(error)** in the catch block to log the error details.

**Key Points:**
1. **logger.error(), logger.warn(), logger.info()**: Used instead of console.log() for more structured logging.
2. **Winston**: Allows logging to both files and the console with customizable formats.
3. **CRUD operations:** You perform basic operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting users while logging significant actions and errors.

This structure ensures that your application logs all critical events, including errors, warnings, and other useful information, in a way that's easy to maintain and monitor.
